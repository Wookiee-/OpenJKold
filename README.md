# OpenJK Extra (Linux Server Side)

## Direction of OpenJK Extra

This is based from OpenJK source and selected code added from the jaPRO/EternalJK. I started this project to learn how OpenJK works but wanted to help those who play base on a regular basis.

## Features 

* Private duels now start with full health and shield, and can be changed via new cvars (g_duelStartHealth and g_duelStartArmor)
* Private duels the winner is restored to 100/25
* Results of a private duel are displayed to all, with the remaining health of the winning player
* ConsoleMOTD and CenterMOTD
* Sliding on players head on/off
* Duel Distance Limit on/off 
* Council, Knight and Instructor admin level
* Clan chat support for scrims 
* JKA/JO Saber Ghoul2Collision can be toggled on/off

* Emotes (removed till I find some that works)
* EternalJK (Credit to Bucky) openjkded for duel isolation and many more.
